              1. Cloud Computing Basics
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              This foundational stage, introduces learners to the core concepts of cloud computing. It
              includes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-2">
              <li>
                <strong>What is Cloud Computing?</strong>: Defined as the
                delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases,
                networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the
                internet, offering on-demand access. Research from sources like
                AWS and IBM highlights its pay-as-you-go model, enabling
                flexibility and scalability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloud Computing Benefits</strong>: Includes cost
                efficiency by reducing capital expenditure, scalability to
                adjust resources based on demand, flexibility for remote access,
                reliability through high availability, and innovation via access
                to advanced technologies like AI and machine learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloud Models</strong>:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Public</strong>: Services offered over the public
                    internet, shared among multiple organizations (e.g., AWS,
                    Azure).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Private</strong>: Dedicated infrastructure for a
                    single organization, often on-premises or hosted (e.g.,
                    VMware Private Cloud).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Hybrid</strong>: Combines public and private clouds
                    for flexibility, allowing data and applications to be shared
                    (e.g., Azure Arc).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Multi</strong>: Uses multiple providers to avoid
                    vendor lock-in and optimize costs (e.g., using AWS and GCP
                    together).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloud vs. On-Premise</strong>: Compares cloud computing
                with traditional on-premises infrastructure, noting that while
                on-premises offers full control, it requires significant
                investment and maintenance, whereas cloud shifts these burdens
                to providers, focusing on innovation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              This stage is crucial for building a conceptual understanding.

                Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, and Google App Engine,
                ideal for developers focusing on coding. It removes the need for
                hardware and OS management, enhancing efficiency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SaaS (Software as a Service)</strong>: Delivers software
                applications over the internet on a subscription basis, with the
                provider managing all infrastructure. Examples include Google
                Workspace, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office 365, perfect for
                businesses needing ready-to-use applications without
                maintenance. Sources like IBM and Red Hat highlight the
                differences in control levels, with SaaS offering the least and
                IaaS the most.
