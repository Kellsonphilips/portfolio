          As more businesses move to the cloud for scalability, accessibility, and
          performance, ensuring cloud environments are secure has become critical.
          Cloud security protects data, applications, and infrastructures involved
          in cloud computing. Here are the best practices for keeping your cloud
          environment secure.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          1. Understand Shared Responsibility
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563986768609-322da13575f3?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="Shared responsibility model"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
          priority
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use a shared
          responsibility model. The provider secures the infrastructure, while you
          must secure your data, user access, and configurations. Knowing where
          your responsibilities begin and end is crucial to avoiding
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          2. Use Strong Identity and Access Management (IAM)
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551434678-e076c223a692?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="IAM security"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Control who can access what in your cloud environment. Use the principle
          of least privilege, enabling only the necessary permissions. Use
          Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of protection
          for access points.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          3. Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581094794329-c8112a89af12?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="Data encryption"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed without
          authorization, it cannot be read. Use strong encryption algorithms like
          AES-256 for data storage and SSL/TLS for data transmission.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          4. Regularly Monitor and Audit Activity
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509395176047-4a66953fd231?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="Monitoring logs"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Set up logging and monitoring tools like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor,
          or GCP Cloud Audit Logs to track changes, access, and activity. Regular
          audits help identify suspicious behavior or configuration errors
          quickly.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          5. Configure Security Groups and Firewalls
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="Firewall protection"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Always configure cloud security groups and firewall rules to block
          unnecessary traffic. Only allow specific IPs and ports required by your
          applications. Consider using web application firewalls (WAFs) for extra
          protection.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          6. Keep Systems and Dependencies Updated
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165804606-c3d57bc86b40?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="System update"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Cloud-based applications often use open-source libraries and packages.
          Ensure all your software, operating systems, and containers are up to
          date with security patches to avoid known vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          7. Implement Backups and Disaster Recovery
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544197150-b99a580bb7a8?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"
          alt="Cloud backup"
          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Accidents, cyberattacks, and outages happen. Ensure regular, automated
          backups of critical data and test your disaster recovery plan to make
          sure you can recover quickly and fully.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          8. Conduct Regular Security Assessments
        </h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550751827-4bd374c3f58b?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"

          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing regularly. These
          assessments identify weak points in your cloud setup and provide
          actionable insights to improve security.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">9. Educate Your Team</h2>
        <Image
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?w=800&h=500&fit=crop&q=80"

          width={800}
          height={500}
          className="rounded-lg mb-4"
        />
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Security is a team effort. Train your developers, admins, and
          stakeholders on cloud security principles, phishing awareness, and
          incident response procedures.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
          Cloud security is not a one-time task—it&apos;s an ongoing process of
          implementing, monitoring, and improving practices to protect your data
          and services. By following the best practices above, you&apos;ll build a
          strong defense for your cloud environment.
